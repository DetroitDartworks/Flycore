Kodachi Flycore Dart Guides
* Dart Guides should better fit tachi and koda mag feed lips, solving most of the catching and retention issues those mags have with Flycores. Also, edited the screw hole recesses so they can print without supports.

FJZ05 Noidcore
* Noidcore fork designed for the 15mm stroke FJZ05 Solenoid
* Only available in Micro/Mini Wheel flycores due to stroke length
* WIP Beta release. Can be picky about darts and especially dart length

DDW Angled Noidcore
* Noidcore fork combinging the angled Flycore with the Noidcore
* Requires a pusher nub and sits slightly longer than the standard noidcore

DDW Gearcore
* Manual pusher flycore
* Uses a 3:1 rack and pinion gear system
* Straight talon only
